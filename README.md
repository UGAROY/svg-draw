# svg-draw
A lightwweight library to add svg drawing overlay on elements.

Different from existing "giant" svg editing libraries, its main purpose is to add "marks" on dom elements. We can have multiple canvases within one page.

A live demo can be found [here](http://ugaroy.github.io/examples/svg-draw/).

The basic usage is:
```
var svgCanvas = VectorEditor.Editor(element);
```


P.S: If you are looking for online svg editing library, you might want to check out [svg-edit](https://github.com/johan/svg-edit) or [method-draw](https://github.com/duopixel/Method-Draw).
