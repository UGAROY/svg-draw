# svg-draw
A lightwweight library to add svg drawing overlay on elements.

A live demo can be found [here](http://ugaroy.github.io/examples/svg-draw/).

Different from svg editing library, its main purpose is to add "marks" on dom elements. We can have multiple canvases within one page.

The basic usage is:
```
var svgCanvas = VectorEditor.Editor(element);
```


P.S: If you are looking for online svg editing library, you might want to check out [svg-edit](https://github.com/johan/svg-edit) or [method-draw](https://github.com/duopixel/Method-Draw).
